## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Search for GitHub users by their username
- See relevant user information based on their search
- Switch between light and dark themes
- **Bonus**: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences. _Hint_: Research `prefers-color-scheme` in CSS.

    I have met all the user stories listed about along with the bonus challenge
    of checking to see if the user has set a light or dark theme preference and
    setting the app theme appropriately.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Vite Frontend Tooling
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styling


### What I learned

- How to change the app theme with a custom attribute and javascript.
- More practice with flexbox and grid; I'm trying to figure out when to use one
    or the other.
- More practice with building an app from a design file (Figma).

### Continued development
